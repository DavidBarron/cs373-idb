#### Project Goals

Create a Web app hosted on Rackspace that emulates IMDB to track something.

This is a group project with three phases and only one repo will be used across all of the three phases.

A RESTful API must be implemented and it must be documented using Apiary.

The GUI must be implemented using Bootstrap.

The frontend must be implemented using JavaScript and AngularJS or React.

The backend must be implemented using Python and Django or Flask.

The DB must be implemented using Django's ORM or SQLAlchemy and MySQL or PostgreSQL.

The website must be hosted on Rackspace, using a URL provided by Namecheap.

The group must collaborate using Slack and it must be integrated with the GitHub repo.

#### Topic Chosen

Gather information on divisions, teams, and players of the National Football League.

Seriously! I am really suprised of the fact that Github would not tracked the name of author other than the one that had been registed on Github, even thought I had published my work in the name of "NL" instead of "killvung", Github wouldn't bother to make a note of it, so I would either have to convince people outside of project that I had really worked on the materials, or let them believe that I was a free rider here for all time...<br>

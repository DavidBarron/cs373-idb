A RESTful API must be implemented and it must be documented using Apiary.

The GUI must be implemented using Bootstrap.

The frontend must be implemented using JavaScript and AngularJS or React.

The backend must be implemented using Python and Django or Flask.

The DB must be implemented using Django's ORM or SQLAlchemy and MySQL or PostgreSQL.

The website must be hosted on Rackspace, using a URL provided by Namecheap.

The group must collaborate using Slack and it must be integrated with the GitHub repo.
